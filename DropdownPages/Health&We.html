    <h2>Healthy Weight</h2>
    <p>More than two-thirds of American adults are considered overweight or obese. Excess weight may lead to heart
        disease and diabetes. Creating and following plans for healthy eating and physical activity may help you
        improve your health.

    </p>
    <h2>What is a healthy weight?</h2>
    <p>Body mass index (BMI) is one way to tell whether you are at a healthy weight, overweight, or obese. It measures
        your weight in relation to your height.

        A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is in the healthy range. A person with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight, and
        someone with a BMI of 30 or greater is considered obese.

        Go to the tip sheet to find a BMI table you can use to find your BMI score. You may also check the Additional
        Links section section for a link to an online tool for measuring BMI.

        Another way to find out if you are at risk for health problems caused by overweight and obesity is to measure
        your waist. If you are a woman and your waist is more than 35 inches, or if you are a man and your waist is
        more than 40 inches, your risk of disease may be higher.

        <h2>Healthy Eating</h2>
        <p>Paying attention to what, when, how often, and how much you eat can be the first step to helping you eat
            better.<br /><br />

            <b>What kinds of foods should I eat?</b><br />
            Every 5 years the Government releases dietary guidelines that recommend what kinds of food to eat and to
            limit so you can have a healthy eating plan.<br /><br />

            Eat more of these nutrient-rich foods<br />

            <b>Nutrients—like vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber—nourish </b> our bodies by giving them what they
            need to be healthy. <br />
            The guidelines advise adults to eat the following foods because they are rich in nutrients:<br />

            fruits and vegetables,
            whole grains, like oatmeal, whole-wheat bread, and brown rice,
            seafood, lean meats, poultry, and eggs
            fat-free or low-fat milk and cheese, or substitutes (like soy or rice milk) that are high in vitamin D and
            calcium
            beans, nuts, and seeds,<br />
            <b>Eat less of these foods</b>

            Some foods have many calories but few of the vitamins, minerals, or fiber your body needs. Added sugars,
            solid fats, and refined grains pack a lot of calories into food but do not add nutrients. <br />The
            Government's dietary guidelines recommend that you limit foods such as these:

            sugar-sweetened drinks and desserts
            foods with butter, shortening, or other fats that are solid at room temperature
            white bread, rice, and pasta that are made from refined grains
            Easy Snack Ideas

            low-fat or fat-free yogurt
            fresh, canned, or dried fruit
            sliced vegetables or baby carrots<br />
            <b>Quick Breakfast Ideas</b><br />

            oatmeal with low-fat or fat-free milk or a soy-based drink, topped with walnuts and fresh or dried fruit
            a slice of whole-wheat toast with a thin piece of low-fat cheese
            fruit smoothie made with frozen fruit and low-fat yogurt
            high-fiber, low-sugar cereal with a soy-based beverage or fat-free milk
