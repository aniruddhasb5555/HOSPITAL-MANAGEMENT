                <p>
                    William K. Warren, Sr., founder of The William K. Warren
                    Foundation and the Saint Francis Health System, along with his
                    wife Natalie Overall Warren, dreamed of giving a gift to the
                    city of Tulsa that would serve its citizens for years to come.
                    That dream became reality when Saint Francis Hospital opened
                    its doors in 1960.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    William K. Warren, Jr. served as Chairman of The William K.
                    Warren Foundation for many years after his father's retirement
                    and remains Chairman Emeritus. Mr. Warren envisioned a place
                    where those suffering from mental illness would be treated the
                    same as patients having any other illness. That vision became

                <p>
                    <strong>The Beginning</strong>
                    <br />
                    The story of the Saint Francis Health System is as colorful as
                    the man whose dream brought it life. In 1916, when William K.
                    Warren first arrived in Oklahoma, he was an impressionable
                    19-year-old. He took on a job in the big city as a voucher
                    clerk at Gypsy Oil Company.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Shortly after Bill Warren married Natalie Overall, he quit his
                    job at Gypsy Oil and started his own business with $300 to his
                    name. The employees of Warren Petroleum Company consisted of
                    Warren and his new bride.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Saint Francis Hospital</strong>
                    <br />
                    Through the years, Warren Petroleum Company steadily grew and
                    prospered to great heights, as did the Warrens' desire to give
                    something back to the community. On October 1, 1960, their
                    dream finally became a reality. After five years of planning
                    and construction, Saint Francis Hospital opened its doors with
                    275 beds.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In order to meet patient care requirements, as well as the
                    demands of a rapidly growing population in southeast Tulsa, the
                    hospital was expanded in 1969 to 735 adult and pediatric beds
                    and bassinets. The expansion included a new "Y" section to
                    match the original structure and a seven-story specialty wing.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planning began almost immediately for a third phase of
                    development at Saint Francis Hospital with expansion projects
                    planned for completion during the 1970s.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A major milestone occurred on December 3, 1975 - the 15th
                    anniversary of the hospital - when the Natalie Warren Bryant
                    Cancer Center opened its doors. It was one of the first centers
                    where radiation therapy, chemotherapy services, laboratory and
                    support services were grouped in a single location for the
                    patient's convenience.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    During 1979, Saint Francis Hospital launched many new services.
                    Tulsa Life Flight, the helicopter service that transports
                    critically ill or injured patients, took off during this
                    monumental year and was the first of its kind offered in the
                    city. Other services added in 1979 were a skilled nursing
                    facility and a fetal maternal medicine unit.

                    <strong>Warren Clinic</strong>
                    <br />
                    The first area Warren Clinic was established in Stillwater,
                    Oklahoma, in January 1988. In physician numbers alone since
                    that time, the clinic has grown from three internal medicine
                    specialists in Stillwater, to more than 370 providers now in
                    practice throughout eastern Oklahoma. Warren Clinic today
                    consists of physician offices in several Oklahoma communities,
                    including several practice locations in Tulsa. Other Warren
                    Clinic sites include Vinita, Owasso, Coweta, Broken Arrow,
                    Catoosa, Sand Springs, Jenks and McAlester.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In November 1997, Medical Care Associates of Tulsa (MCAT)
                    joined Warren Clinic. In December of 2005, the physicians and
                    staff of Springer Clinic became a part of Warren Clinic.

                    <strong>Laureate Psychiatric Clinic and Hospital</strong>
                    <br />
                    In 1989, The William K. Warren Foundation established Laureate
                    Psychiatric Clinic and Hospital, as well as Laureate
                    Psychiatric Research Center. In addition to programs for
                    children, adolescents and adults, Laureate also offers
                    successful specialty programs for patients with chemical
                    dependency and mood disorders. Laureate's Eating Disorders
                    Program is nationally recognized for its outstanding treatment
                    of anorexia, bulimia and compulsive overeating.

                    <strong>The Children's Hospital at Saint Francis</strong>
                    <br />
                    In 1995, The Children's Hospital at Saint Francis was
                    established. This "hospital within a hospital" was created with
                    younger patients in mind. Its goal was to improve access and
                    efficiency, as well as to provide a larger and more "kid
                    friendly" atmosphere for children and their families. The
                    Children's Hospital at Saint Francis is a regional referral
                    center which provides specialized pediatric inpatient care, as
                    well as neonatal and pediatric intensive care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2005, ground broke on the 155,000 square foot Children's
                    Hospital seen today. The five-story structure opened in 2008
                    and features a kid friendly design, private rooms with a family
                    centered environment and equipment specific to pediatric
                    patients. Today, The Children's Hospital at Saint Francis
                    offers services in more than 25 different pediatric specialties
                    including the regions only Level IV NICU, pediatric
                    hematology/oncology clinic and pediatric cardiac surgery
                    program.

                    <strong>Saint Francis Hospital at Broken Arrow</strong>
                    <br />
                    Saint Francis Hospital at Broken Arrow officially became part
                    of the Saint Francis Health System in January 1998; yet, the
                    history uniting the two began a decade earlier. This union
                    occurred when Saint Francis Hospital at Broken Arrow affiliated
                    with Saint Francis Hospital on January 1, 1986.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In 2008, services and staff moved to the newly dedicated Saint
                    Francis Hospital South, located down the street at 91st Street
                    and Hwy 169. In 2012 Saint Francis Health System and the Broken
                    Arrow Chamber of Commerce dedicated the Saint Francis Health
                    Park, a community park with a fitness focus where Saint Francis
                    Hospital in Broken Arrow once stood.

                    In March 2004, the Saint Francis Health System and area
                    cardiologists joined together as partners to open the Saint
                    Francis Heart Hospital.

                    <br />
                    The need for heart services is great in our area. In fact,
                    heart disease is the leading cause of death in Oklahoma
                    according to a report issued by the American Heart Association
                    in 2010. Smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and
                    lack of exercise are factors that contribute to the problem and
                    place our state high on the unhealthy list.

                    of southern Tulsa and Wagoner counties in Oklahoma. Built with
                    a neighborhood feel, the hospital offers general services as
                    well as many sub-specialties generally reserved for larger city
                    hospitals including a Level II NICU, emergency services,
                    cardiology, urology and 24-hour on site anesthesia.

                    Friend, who donated the land in the early 1960s. The hospital,
                    which opened in 1963, became part of the Saint Francis Health
                    System in December, 2016. It, along with the existing Warren
                    Clinic Vinita and the newly named Saint Francis Health Centers
                    located in Langley and Monkey Island, provide area residents

                    <br />
                    What began as one young man's dream, Saint Francis has grown to
                    become Oklahoma's largest healthcare network with multiple
                    locations and more than 9,500 employees. The Health System is
                    still locally owned and operated in Tulsa, OK, meaning the
                    administrative decisions that affect the region are made in the
                    region. "Just making money for somebody is one thing," W.K.
                    Warren once said. "...but saving lives is something else."

                                    Warren Clinic is dedicated to providing the
                                    highest quality care to its patients. Quality
                                    committees made up of primary care and
                                    specialty care physicians, nurses, clinical
                                    assistants and administration staff meet on a
                                    regular basis to monitor and improve quality
                                    measures. Special emphasis is given to the care
                                    of patients with diabetes through quality
                                    projects and special reporting to ensure
                                    evidence based care of the highest quality is
                                    provided to our patients.

                                    To monitor and evaluate how Warren Clinic
                                    patients rate their experiences in the offices
                                    and with physicians and staff, patient
                                    satisfaction surveys are performed on a regular
                                    basis. Press Ganey, a professional research
                                    group based in South Bend, Indiana, mails
                                    surveys to patients who have recently visited
                                    the Clinic and asks the patients to "score"
                                    offices on a variety of measures from ease of
                                    appointment scheduling to time spent with
                                    physicians. These "scores" are then analyzed by
                                    Warren Clinic administration, physicians and
                                    managers and are also compared to scores of
                                    other clinics across the country. Understanding
                                    how well patients are satisfied helps Warren
                                    Clinic recognize both areas that are successful
                                    and areas needing improvement.
